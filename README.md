# Miva & WordPress Hybrids

Miva's URI management and WordPresses Permalinks can be coordinated to work on the same domain.

This there are two file structures in this repo to help demonstrate how Miva & WordPress can be installed at a site's web root:

## [Miva is Primary*](miva-is-primary#miva-is-primary)

## [WordPress is Primary*](wordpress-is-primary#wordpress-is-primary)

_*Note:_ By "Primary" I just mean that going to www.example.com will pull up that CMS's content. The alternate CMS's content will only be visible when using its "sub-directory" in the URL.
